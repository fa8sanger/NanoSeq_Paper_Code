# NanoSeq_Paper_Code

This repository contains the code for the main downstream analyses presented in the 
manuscript.

The repository for  processing of NanoSeq libraries, calling substitutions, and calculating
mutation burden is available at:

https://github.com/cancerit/NanoSeq

Below is a brief summary of the content of each directory:

BLOOD_REGRESSIONS: contains R code and accompanying data to do the regression analysis of
granulocytes and stem cell colonies

BURDEN_IN_SPECIFIC_REGIONS: code to estimate burden in specific genomic regions such as
expressed genes or heterochromatin, for example. Instructions are provided in the shell
script named burden_specific_regions_pipeline.sh 

CORRECTION_BURDEN_STD_SEQUENCING: code to 
FMOL_VS_LIBCOMPLEXITY
GENOME_MASKS
INDEL_CALLING
INSILICO_DIGESTION
NEURONS_SINGLECELLSEQ_SIGNATURES
SIGNATURE_EXTRACTION
